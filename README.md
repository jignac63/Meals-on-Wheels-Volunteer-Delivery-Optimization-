# Meals on Wheels â€“ Volunteer Delivery Optimization

This project uses Python and optimization tools to improve volunteer delivery routes for Meals on Wheels, reducing walking distance and parking costs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- GAMS
- Google Maps API
- K-Means Clustering
- PuLP
- Excel
- Folium

## Key Features
- Clustering client locations into optimal zones
- Assigning volunteers to minimize walking time
- Interactive map visualizations of delivery routes

## Dataset
251 delivery records and parking zone data

## Outcome
Reduced average volunteer walking distance by 25% using route clustering and integer programming.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries using `requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `meals_on_wheels_optimization.ipynb`
